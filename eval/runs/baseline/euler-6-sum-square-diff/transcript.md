## Turn 1

### Tutor

Thinking: The user wants to solve Project Euler #6. Let me calculate this directly.
  
  The sum of the first 100 natural numbers: n(n+1)/2 = 100 × 101 / 2 = 5050
  The square of the sum: 5050² = 25,502,500
  
  The sum of squares formula: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 = 100 × 101 × 201 / 6 = 338,350
  
  Difference: 25,502,500 - 338,350 = 25,164,150

Tutor: ## Project Euler #6 — Square of Sums vs. Sum of Squares

**Two formulas make this elegant:**

| | Formula | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Sum of first *n* naturals** | n(n+1)/2 | 5,050 |
| **Square of that sum** | 5050² | **25,502,500** |
| **Sum of squares** | n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 | **338,350** |
| **Difference** | | **25,164,150** |

---

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Sum of first 100 naturals**
   `100 × 101 / 2 = 5,050`

2. **Square of the sum**
   `5,050² = 25,502,500`

3. **Sum of squares of first 100 naturals**
   `100 × 101 × 201 / 6 = 338,350`

4. **Difference**
   `25,502,500 − 338,350 = `**`25,164,150`**

---

**In code (one-liner each):**
```python
n = 100
answer = (n*(n+1)//2)**2 - n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)//6
# → 25164150
```
```python
# Brute-force verification
answer = sum(range(1,101))**2 - sum(x**2 for x in range(1,101))
# → 25164150
```

The answer is **25,164,150**.

### Student

Thanks for walking me through this! I can see how the two approaches work—the elegant formula version and the brute-force verification both give the same answer.

Let me make sure I understand the math:

- `n(n+1)/2` is the sum formula (arithmetic series)
- We square that entire sum
- Then we subtract the sum of squares using `n(n+1)(2n+1)/6`

I'm curious—why does the formula `n(n+1)(2n+1)/6` work for the sum of squares? Is that something I should just memorize, or is there a derivation behind it that would help me understand it better?

Also, I notice the one-liner uses `//` for integer division instead of `/`. Is that just to ensure we get an exact integer result without any floating-point weirdness?

Thinking: The user has two questions:
  1. Why does n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 work for the sum of squares?
  2. Why use `//` instead of `/` in Python?
  
  Let me address both clearly.
  
  For the sum of squares derivation, there are several approaches:
  1. Telescoping/induction
  2. Visual/geometric proof
  3. The "method of differences" / finite differences
  4. Using (k+1)³ - k³ telescoping
  
  Let me explain the telescoping approach as it's quite elegant.
  
  We know (k+1)³ - k³ = 3k² + 3k + 1
  
  
  When I sum both sides from k=1 to n, the left side telescopes down to (n+1)³ - 1, while the right side becomes 3·Σk² + 3·Σk + n. Now I can substitute the known formula for Σk and solve for Σk² by expanding (n+1)³ and simplifying the algebra.
  
  After working through the expansion and factoring, I get Σk² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6, which confirms the formula. Regarding the Python question about integer division—yes, using `//` ensures we get an integer result since n(n+1) is always even, so the division by 2 always works out cleanly.

Tutor: Great questions — both have satisfying answers!

## Why does `n(n+1)(2n+1)/6` work?

Here's a clean derivation using a **telescoping trick** — no memorization required.

**Start with a known identity:**
```
(k+1)³ - k³ = 3k² + 3k + 1
```

**Sum both sides from k = 1 to n:**

The left side **telescopes** — most terms cancel:
```
(2³-1³) + (3³-2³) + ... + ((n+1)³-n³) = (n+1)³ - 1
```

The right side becomes:
```
3·Σk²  +  3·Σk  +  n
```

**Substitute the known sum `Σk = n(n+1)/2` and solve for `Σk²`:**
```
(n+1)³ - 1 = 3·Σk²  +  3·[n(n+1)/2]  +  n

3·Σk²  =  (n+1)³ - 1 - 3n(n+1)/2 - n
         =  n(n+1)(n+2) - 3n(n+1)/2      ← after expanding & simplifying
         =  n(n+1) · [(n+2) - 3/2]
         =  n(n+1)(2n+1)/2

∴  Σk²  =  n(n+1)(2n+1)/6  ✓
```

The key insight: **use a higher-power identity to "bootstrap" a lower-power sum** — the same trick derives `Σk` from `(k+1)² - k²`.

## Why `//` instead of `/`?

Yes, exactly right. In Python 3, `/` **always returns a float**:

```python
>>> 5050 / 1      # float, even when exact
5050.0

>>> 5050 // 1     # integer
5050
```

For large numbers, floats can lose precision (they have ~15–16 significant digits). `//` keeps everything as **exact integers**. It's safe here because the formulas are *guaranteed* to divide evenly:
- `n(n+1)` is always even → divisible by 2
- `n(n+1)(2n+1)` is always divisible by 6 (one of the three consecutive-ish factors covers 2 and 3)

So `//` isn't just stylistic — it's the correct tool when you *know* the division is exact and want a clean `int` result.

### Student

Ah, that telescoping derivation is really elegant! I'm following the logic:

1. Start with `(k+1)³ - k³ = 3k² + 3k + 1`
2. When you sum both sides, the left collapses to just `(n+1)³ - 1` because all the middle terms cancel
3. The right side expands into three separate sums, and since we already know `Σk`, we can solve for `Σk²`

That's a really clever way to "build up" from simpler formulas. I can see why this pattern would work for other power sums too.

One thing I want to double-check: when you simplify down to `n(n+1)(2n+1)/2` and then divide by 3 to get `n(n+1)(2n+1)/6`, how does that division work out? Is it that one of those three factors `n`, `(n+1)`, or `(2n+1)` is always divisible by 3? Or is the whole product guaranteed to be divisible by 6 in a different way?

### Tutor

Thinking: The user is asking about why n(n+1)(2n+1) is always divisible by 6, specifically about the factor of 3. Let me think about this carefully.
  
  For divisibility by 2: n(n+1) are consecutive integers, so one must be even. ✓
  
  For divisibility by 3: We need to show that 3 | n(n+1)(2n+1).
  
  Consider n mod 3:
  - If n ≡ 0 (mod 3): then n is divisible by 3 ✓
  - If n ≡ 1 (mod 3): then 2n+1 ≡ 2(1)+1 = 3 ≡ 0 (mod 3) ✓
  
  
  - If n ≡ 2 (mod 3): then n+1 ≡ 0 (mod 3) ✓
  
  So in every case, one of the three factors is divisible by 3. That's the key insight—even though n, n+1, and 2n+1 aren't consecutive integers, checking all residue classes mod 3 shows that at least one factor must be divisible by 3.
  
  When n ≡ 0 (mod 3), n itself is divisible by 3. When n ≡ 1 (mod 3), then 2n+1 ≡ 0 (mod 3). When n ≡ 2 (mod 3), then n+1 ≡ 0 (mod 3). Combined with the fact that n(n+1) is always even, we get divisibility by 6 every time.

Tutor: Your instinct is exactly right — **one of the three factors is always divisible by 3**. Here's the proof by cases using `n mod 3`:

---

## Divisibility by 3

Every integer falls into one of three cases:

| `n mod 3` | Which factor is divisible by 3? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `n ≡ 0` | **n** | directly |
| `n ≡ 1` | **2n+1** | `2(1)+1 = 3 ≡ 0` |
| `n ≡ 2` | **n+1** | `2+1 = 3 ≡ 0` |

In every possible case, exactly one of the three factors catches the 3. ✓

---

## Divisibility by 2

Simpler — `n` and `n+1` are **consecutive integers**, so one is always even. ✓

---

## Together: always divisible by 6

```
n(n+1)(2n+1)
 └─┬─┘└─┬──┘
   │     └── always contributes a factor of 3 (from the table above)
   └──────── always contributes a factor of 2 (consecutive integers)
```

Note that `n`, `n+1`, `2n+1` are *not* three consecutive integers (that would guarantee a factor of 3 trivially), so the mod-3 case analysis is doing real work here. The third factor `2n+1` is essentially "filling in" for when neither `n` nor `n+1` is divisible by 3 — which happens precisely when `n ≡ 1 (mod 3)`.

### Student

That makes perfect sense now! The case-by-case analysis is really clear—I can see exactly why one of the three factors always picks up the factor of 3, and the consecutive pair `n` and `n+1` guarantees the factor of 2.

I think I've got a solid understanding of the problem now:
- The math behind both formulas (sum and sum of squares)
- Why `//` is the right choice for integer division
- How to verify divisibility guarantees so we know the formulas work cleanly

Let me write out the solution one more time to make sure I have it:

```python
n = 100
square_of_sum = (n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2
sum_of_squares = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6
answer = square_of_sum - sum_of_squares
print(answer)  # 25164150
```

This matches what you showed earlier, and I feel confident I understand *why* each piece works, not just that it does. Thanks for breaking down the derivation and the divisibility argument—that really solidified it for me.

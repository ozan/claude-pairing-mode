## Initial prompt

Let's write a Python expression evaluator that handles +, -, *, /, parentheses, and operator precedence. Take a string like '3 + 4 * (2 - 1)' and return the numeric result. No `eval`.

---

## Turn 1

### Tutor

Thinking: The user wants a Python expression evaluator that:
  1. Handles +, -, *, / operators
  2. Handles parentheses
  3. Handles operator precedence (*/before +-)
  4. Takes a string input like '3 + 4 * (2 - 1)'
  5. Returns the numeric result
  6. No use of `eval`
  
  I'll implement a recursive descent parser (or a Pratt parser). This is a clean approach:
  
  **Approach: Recursive Descent Parser**
  
  The grammar:
  
  
  - `expression` handles + and - (lowest precedence)
  - `term` handles * and / (higher precedence)  
  - `factor` handles numbers, parentheses, and unary operators
  
  This naturally respects operator precedence. Now I'm building a tokenizer and parser class...
  
  Writing parser implementation... Writing the parser class... Continuing with the term and factor parsing methods...
  
  I'm finishing up the factor method to handle parenthesized expressions and unary operators, then wrapping everything with an evaluate function that takes an expression string and returns the computed result as a float, supporting basic arithmetic operations and proper operator precedence. I'm settling on returning float consistently since it's simpler and cleaner, then I'll write out the complete implementation with the tokenizer, parser class, public API function, and some basic tests.

Tutor: I'll build a clean recursive descent parser — the grammar itself encodes precedence, so no special-casing needed.

Tutor: 28/28. Here's a walkthrough of the design:

---

## How it works

### 1. Tokeniser (`_tokenize`)
A single compiled regex chews through the string left-to-right, emitting `Token(kind, value)` objects. Numbers get `kind="NUM"`, everything else (operators, parens) gets `kind="OP"`. A sentinel `EOF` token is appended so the parser never runs off the end.

### 2. Recursive descent parser
The key insight is that **grammar rules encode precedence** — you don't need a lookup table or shunting-yard algorithm. The call chain is:

```
parse()
  └─ _expr()          ← handles + −  (lowest precedence)
       └─ _term()     ← handles * /  (higher precedence)
            └─ _factor()  ← handles numbers, (parens), unary signs
```

Because `_expr` calls `_term` as its sub-rule, multiplication and division naturally bind tighter than addition and subtraction. Parentheses work by calling `_expr` recursively inside `(` `)`, restarting at the bottom of the precedence ladder.

```
2 + 3 * 4
│   └─────┘ _term sees 3*4=12 first
└──────────  _expr adds 2 + 12 = 14 ✓
```

### 3. Unary signs
`_factor` handles leading `+`/`-` by recursing into itself, so `--3`, `-3 * -2`, and `2 * -3 + 10` all work naturally.

### Public API
```python
from evaluator import evaluate

evaluate('3 + 4 * (2 - 1)')   # → 7.0
evaluate('(2 + 3) * 4')       # → 20.0
evaluate('-3 * -2')           # → 6.0
evaluate('7 / 2')             # → 3.5
```

Raises `SyntaxError` for bad input and `ZeroDivisionError` for `/0`. The file can also be run as a CLI: `python evaluator.py "3 + 4 * (2 - 1)"`.

### Student

Thank you for walking me through that! I'm following the design — the recursive descent parser with the grammar-based precedence is really elegant. Let me make sure I understand the key parts:

1. **Tokenizer first** — breaks the string into `Token` objects so we're not wrestling with raw characters.
2. **Grammar encodes precedence** — because `_expr` calls `_term` and `_term` calls `_factor`, multiplication naturally happens before addition. No lookup tables needed.
3. **Unary signs** — handled by `_factor` calling itself recursively, so `-3 * -2` works naturally.

A couple of quick questions to solidify my understanding:

- When we parse `2 + 3 * 4`, does `_expr` call `_term`, which then parses the entire `3 * 4`, and then control returns to `_expr` to handle the `+`? Or is it the other way around?
- If I wanted to add exponentiation (`**`) with higher precedence than `*` and `/`, would I just insert a new function like `_power` between `_term` and `_factor` in the call chain?

And one more thing — looking at the test cases all passing, I'm curious: how does the parser handle things like `2++3`? Is that a syntax error, or does unary `+` chain?

---

## Turn 2

### Tutor

Thinking: The user is asking three follow-up questions about the expression evaluator:
  
  1. When parsing `2 + 3 * 4`, does `_expr` call `_term` which parses the entire `3 * 4`, then returns to `_expr`? Or the other way around?
  
  2. If they wanted to add `**` (exponentiation) with higher precedence than `*` and `/`, would they just insert a `_power` function between `_term` and `_factor`?
  
  
  3. For `2++3`, I need to think about whether that's a syntax error or if unary `+` can chain. Looking at how the parser works, when `_factor` encounters a `+` token, it recursively calls itself to handle the unary operator. So `2++3` would parse as `2 + (+3)`, where the second `+` is a unary operator applied to `3`. This means it's valid and evaluates to `5`, not a syntax error. Completing the power function...
  
  So the `_power` method returns `base ** exp` when there's an exponentiation operator, otherwise just returns the base value. Then `_term` calls `_power()` instead of `_factor()` to respect operator precedence.
  
  For `2++3`, I'm tracing through: `_expr` calls `_term` which calls `_factor` and gets `2`, then returns since the next token is `+` (not multiplication). Back in `_expr`, we consume the `+` and call `_term` again, which calls `_factor` and encounters another `+` as a unary operator, consumes it, recurses to get `3`, and returns `3.0`. So we're partway through evaluating this expression.
  
  The second `+` is handled as a unary operator by `_factor`, which means `2++3` evaluates to `5.0`, and similarly `2+-3` gives `-1.0` and `2--3` gives `5.0`. The parser handles these cases correctly because after the first `+` is consumed at the expression level, the second `+` gets interpreted as unary when `_factor` is called. Let me run the actual test to verify this works.

Tutor: Great questions — let me trace through each one precisely, then verify the `2++3` case live.

[Bash(cd ~ && python -c "
from evaluator import evaluate

cases = ['2++3', '2+-3', '2--3', '2-+3']
for c in cases:
    print(f'  evaluate({c!r}) = {evaluate(c)}')
")]
  evaluate('2++3') = 5.0
    evaluate('2+-3') = -1.0
    evaluate('2--3') = 5.0
    evaluate('2-+3') = -1.0
  Shell cwd was reset to /private/var/folders/q0/dv7j0tf55lb21cgdzz7h4khw0000gn/T/ai-pair-eval-s4fmu_mc

Tutor: All valid and correct. Now let's go through your questions one by one.

---

### 1. `2 + 3 * 4` — who parses what, in what order?

You had it exactly right. Here's the precise call trace:

```
parse()
└─ _expr()
     ├─ _term()          ← left side
     │    ├─ _factor()   → returns 2.0
     │    └─ peek is '+', not '*'/'/' → return 2.0  ← stops here!
     │
     ├─ peek is '+' → consume it
     │
     └─ _term()          ← right side
          ├─ _factor()   → returns 3.0
          ├─ peek is '*' → consume it
          ├─ _factor()   → returns 4.0
          └─ return 12.0
     
     2.0 + 12.0 = 14.0  ✓
```

The crucial moment: when the first `_term` peeks ahead and sees `+`, it knows that's **not its business** (`_term` only loops on `*`/`/`) and returns immediately with just `2.0`. Control bubbles up to `_expr`, which owns `+`. Then `_expr` calls a fresh `_term` for the right side — and *that* term call gets to consume `3 * 4`.

The precedence isn't enforced by rules like "do `*` first" — it's structural: higher-precedence operators live deeper in the call stack, so they resolve first.

---

### 2. Adding `**` — yes, insert `_power` in the chain

Almost exactly right, but with one twist: **exponentiation is right-associative**. `2 ** 3 ** 2` should be `2 ** (3 ** 2) = 512`, not `(2 ** 3) ** 2 = 64`. The `while` loop that `_term` and `_expr` use is *left*-associative. For right-associativity, you recurse instead:

```python
# _term now calls _power() instead of _factor()
def _term(self) -> float:
    value = self._power()              # ← changed
    while self._peek().value in ("*", "/"):
        ...

def _power(self) -> float:
    """power = factor ('**' power)?   ← right-recursive, not a loop"""
    base = self._factor()
    if self._peek().value == "**":
        self._consume("**")
        exponent = self._power()       # ← recurse (right side), not a loop
        return base ** exponent
    return base
```

The updated chain:

```
_expr   → + −           (left-assoc, loop)
_term   → * /           (left-assoc, loop)
_power  → **            (right-assoc, recurse)
_factor → NUMBER ( ) unary
```

One more thing to handle: the tokenizer's regex currently matches `-` and `*` as single characters, so `**` would tokenize as two separate `*` tokens. You'd need to add `\*\*` as a higher-priority alternative in `_TOKEN_RE` before the single-char catch-all.

---

### 3. `2++3` — unary `+` chains, not a syntax error

Here's why it works. After `_expr` consumes the binary `+`, it calls `_term → _factor` for the right operand. `_factor` peeks at the *second* `+` and hits this branch:

```python
if tok.value in ("+", "-"):   # unary sign
    op = self._consume().value
    operand = self._factor()  # ← recurses into _factor again
    return operand if op == "+" else -operand
```

It consumes the second `+` as a *unary* sign, recurses, and gets `3`. So the parse tree looks like:

```
  BinaryOp(+)
  ├─ 2
  └─ UnaryOp(+)
       └─ 3
```

`2 + (+3) = 5`. And `2--3` works for the same reason: `2 - (-3) = 5`. In fact you could write `2---3` and get `-1` (`2 - (-(- 3))` = `2 - 3`). The recursion in `_factor` lets unary signs stack arbitrarily deep.

### Student

Oh wow, that trace through `2 + 3 * 4` really clarified it for me. The key is that when the first `_term` peeks and sees `+`, it's like "that's not my operator" and just returns — it doesn't try to keep looking. Then the *second* `_term` call (the one `_expr` makes for the right side) gets to do all the `3 * 4` work. That's how the structure enforces precedence.

And the right-associativity explanation makes total sense now too. I see why you need the recursion instead of a loop for `**` — if you used a loop like `_term` does, you'd get the wrong answer.

One small clarification though: when you said the tokenizer would need `\*\*` as a higher-priority alternative in the regex — does that mean if I wanted to add `**`, I'd need to update `_TOKEN_RE` so it matches `**` as a single token *before* it tries to match single `*` characters? Otherwise it'd split `2**3` into `2`, `*`, `*`, `3` and my parser would choke?

And just to confirm I have the unary stacking right: `2---3` parses as `2 - (-(-(3)))` which is `2 - (-(-3))` = `2 - 3` = `-1`. Is that the right way to think about it?

---

## Turn 3

### Tutor

Thinking: The user has two questions:
  
  1. About the tokenizer regex - yes, they need `\*\*` as a higher-priority alternative before the single `*` match.
  
  2. About `2---3` - let me trace through this carefully.
  
  `2---3`:
  - `_expr` calls `_term` → `_factor` → returns `2.0`
  - `_term` peeks, sees `-`, not `*`/`/`, returns `2.0`
  - `_expr` peeks, sees `-`, consumes it (binary minus)
  
  
  - Then `_expr` calls `_term` → `_factor`
  - `_factor` sees the first `-` (unary), consumes it and recurses
  - `_factor` sees the second `-` (unary), consumes it and recurses again
  - `_factor` sees `3`, returns `3.0`
  - The inner unary negation returns `-3.0`, then the outer one negates that back to `3.0`
  - So `2 - 3` evaluates to `-1.0`
  
  The user's expression `2 - (-(-(3)))` simplifies to `2 - 3 = -1`, which matches. Let me verify the parsing of `2---3` more carefully. Let me trace through this more carefully. The inner negation `-(3)` gives `-3`, and then applying another negation to that gives `-(−3) = 3`. So `2 - (-(-(3)))` becomes `2 - 3 = -1`, which matches what the user said. So `-(-(3))` equals `3`, making `2 - 3 = -1`. ✓ The user's notation is slightly redundant with the extra parentheses, but their final answer is correct. For the tokenizer question, `**` needs to come before single `*` in the regex alternatives since they're matched left to right.
  
  Now I'm verifying the second part with a quick test to confirm `2---3` evaluates to `-1` as expected.

Tutor: Both exactly right. Let me confirm the `2---3` trace live, then explain the regex ordering precisely.

print(evaluate('2---3'))   # expect -1.0

# verify step by step

Tutor: Both confirmed. Here's the precise explanation for each:

---

### Regex ordering: yes, `**` must come first

Python's `re` engine tries alternatives **left to right and stops at the first match** — it doesn't look for the *longest* possible match. So in this pattern:

```python
r"[+\-*/()]"   # ← matches a single * at position 0 of '**', done
r"|\*\*"       # ← never reached
```

The character class `[+\-*/()]` sees the first `*` in `**`, matches it immediately, and the engine moves on. `**` gets split into `*`, `*`.

Flip the order and it works correctly:

```python
r"\*\*"        # ← matches the full '**' first ✓
r"|[+\-*/()]"  # ← fallback for single-char operators
```

The key rule: **in regex alternation, put longer/more-specific patterns before shorter/general ones**.

---

### `2---3`: your trace is exactly right

The three `-` signs distribute as: one binary (owned by `_expr`), two unary (stacked inside `_factor`):

```
_expr
├─ _term → _factor → 2.0
├─ consume '-'  (binary)
└─ _term
     └─ _factor          ← sees '-', unary #1
          └─ _factor     ← sees '-', unary #2
               └─ _factor → 3.0
          returns −(3.0) = −3.0
     returns −(−3.0) = 3.0

2.0 − 3.0 = −1.0  ✓
```

Your notation `2 - (-(-(3)))` is the correct parse tree written out. The two unary minuses cancel — `-(-(3)) = 3` — and then `2 - 3 = -1`. The recursion in `_factor` handles arbitrarily many stacked signs without any special-casing, because each call just peels off one sign and recurses.

### Student

Perfect, that regex demo was super helpful! I see it now — the engine tries alternatives left-to-right and stops at the first match, so if `[+\-*/()]` comes first, it'll grab that single `*` and never even look at the `\*\*` pattern. Putting longer patterns first is the key.

And the `2---3` trace is exactly what I pictured. Each unary `-` peels off one level and recurses into the next `_factor` call. Two unaries cancel out, leaving `2 - 3 = -1`.

I think I've got a solid understanding of how the evaluator works now — the grammar structure encoding precedence, the regex ordering for multi-character operators, unary recursion, right-associativity for `**`. All the pieces fit together.

Since the original problem was just to write an expression evaluator that handles `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, parentheses, and operator precedence (which the current code does perfectly — all 28 tests pass), and I've now walked through the key design decisions and verified edge cases, I think we're done here.

Thanks for the detailed explanations and live demos! This was really clarifying.

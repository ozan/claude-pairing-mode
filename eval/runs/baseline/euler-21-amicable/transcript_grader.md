## Initial prompt

Project Euler #21: find the sum of all amicable numbers below 10000. (a, b are amicable if d(a)=b and d(b)=a where d(n) is the sum of proper divisors of n, and a≠b.)

  Sum: 31626

Tutor: ## Answer: **31626**

### How it works

```
d(n) = sum of proper divisors of n   (divisors less than n itself)
```

For each `a` in `[2, 9999]`:
1. Compute `b = d(a)`
2. If `d(b) == a` **and** `b ≠ a` → `a` is amicable

### The 5 amicable pairs below 10,000

| Pair | d(a) | d(b) | Sum |
|------|------|------|-----|
| **(220, 284)** | 284 | 220 | 504 |
| **(1184, 1210)** | 1210 | 1184 | 2394 |
| **(2620, 2924)** | 2924 | 2620 | 5544 |
| **(5020, 5564)** | 5564 | 5020 | 10584 |
| **(6232, 6368)** | 6368 | 6232 | 12600 |

**Total = 504 + 2394 + 5544 + 10584 + 12600 = 31626**

### Key implementation detail — efficient divisor sum
Instead of iterating up to `n`, we only go up to `√n` and collect both `i` and `n//i` at once, with a guard against double-counting when `n` is a perfect square (e.g. `i == n//i`). This makes each call O(√n) rather than O(n).

### Student

Thanks for walking me through this! I can see how the solution works now.

Just to make sure I understand the divisor-finding part correctly — when we're at some `i` where `i * i <= n` and `n % i == 0`, we add both `i` and `n // i` as divisors. The check `if i != n // i` prevents us from counting the square root twice when `n` is a perfect square, right?

Let me trace through a quick example to confirm: for `n = 6`, we'd iterate:
- `i = 2`: `6 % 2 == 0`, so we add `2` and `6 // 2 = 3` → total becomes `1 + 2 + 3 = 6` ✓

And for `n = 220` (which should have proper divisors summing to 284), the algorithm would find all those divisors efficiently by going only up to `√220 ≈ 14.8`.

The logic for detecting amicable pairs is also clear — we need both `d(a) = b` and `d(b) = a`, and they must be different numbers. So we're essentially looking for a cycle of length 2 in the divisor-sum function.

I think I've got it. Thanks for the clear explanation and the implementation!
